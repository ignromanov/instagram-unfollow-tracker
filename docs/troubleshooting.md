# Troubleshooting Guide - Instagram Unfollow Tracker

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Upload Issues

#### "No data found" Error
**Problem**: The app shows "No data found" after uploading your ZIP file.

**Solutions**:
1. **Check file format**: Ensure you downloaded JSON format (not HTML)
2. **Verify data selection**: Confirm you selected "Followers and Following" section
3. **Check file structure**: Your ZIP should contain files like:
   ```
   connections/followers_and_following/
   ├── following.json
   ├── followers_1.json
   └── followers_2.json (if you have many followers)
   ```
4. **Try sample data**: Click "Load sample" to test if the app works
5. **Re-download data**: Request a new export from Instagram

#### "Invalid file format" Error
**Problem**: The app rejects your ZIP file.

**Solutions**:
1. **Check file extension**: Ensure the file ends with `.zip`
2. **Verify file integrity**: Try re-downloading the ZIP from Instagram
3. **Check file size**: Very large files (>100MB) may cause issues
4. **Browser compatibility**: Try a different browser (Chrome recommended)

#### Upload takes too long
**Problem**: The upload process seems to hang or take forever.

**Solutions**:
1. **Check file size**: Large files (20k+ accounts) may take 5-10 seconds
2. **Close other tabs**: Free up browser memory
3. **Use desktop browser**: Mobile browsers may be slower
4. **Check internet connection**: Ensure stable connection for initial page load

### Processing Issues

#### Slow processing
**Problem**: The app takes a long time to process your data.

**Solutions**:
1. **Account size**: Large accounts (10k+ followers) naturally take longer
2. **Browser performance**: Use Chrome or Firefox for best performance
3. **Close other tabs**: Free up memory and CPU resources
4. **Wait patiently**: Processing 50k accounts can take up to 10 seconds

#### "Out of memory" Error
**Problem**: Browser runs out of memory during processing.

**Solutions**:
1. **Close other tabs**: Free up browser memory
2. **Restart browser**: Clear memory and try again
3. **Use desktop**: Desktop browsers have more memory
4. **Split data**: If possible, use a smaller date range for export

#### Incomplete results
**Problem**: Some accounts are missing from the results.

**Solutions**:
1. **Check export completeness**: Ensure you selected "All time" date range
2. **Verify file structure**: Check that all follower files are present
3. **Account status**: Some accounts may have been deleted or made private
4. **Export timing**: The data is a snapshot from when you requested it

### Display Issues

#### Accounts not showing
**Problem**: Expected accounts don't appear in the results.

**Solutions**:
1. **Check filters**: Ensure no filters are hiding the accounts
2. **Clear search**: Make sure search box is empty
3. **Check all badges**: Look in different badge categories
4. **Account status**: Accounts may be in different categories than expected

#### Incorrect counts
**Problem**: The numbers don't match what you see in Instagram.

**Solutions**:
1. **Export timing**: Instagram data changes constantly
2. **Account changes**: Accounts may have been deleted or made private
3. **Data snapshot**: The export shows the state when you requested it
4. **Instagram updates**: Live Instagram data may differ from export

#### UI not loading properly
**Problem**: The interface doesn't display correctly.

**Solutions**:
1. **Refresh page**: Try reloading the page
