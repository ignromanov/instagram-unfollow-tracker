# FAQ - Instagram Unfollow Tracker

## Privacy & Security

### Is it safe? Where do my data go?
**100% safe and private.** All processing happens locally in your browser. Your Instagram data never leaves your device - nothing is sent to any server or stored anywhere.

### Do I need my Instagram login/password?
**No, absolutely not.** You only need the ZIP file from Instagram's official Data Download feature (JSON format). No login credentials required.

### What data does the app access?
The app only processes the "Followers and Following" section from your Instagram data export. It doesn't access posts, messages, photos, or any other personal content.

## Functionality

### What do "Not following back" and "Not followed back" mean?
- **Not following back** — accounts you follow who do not follow you back (pending/permanent requests are excluded from this check)
- **Not followed back** — accounts that follow you, but you do not follow them
- **Mutuals** — accounts that follow each other
- **Close friends** — accounts marked as close friends in Instagram

### Why are some accounts missing?
Instagram may split followers into multiple files (`followers_1.json`, `followers_2.json`, etc.). The app automatically merges these files when found. If your archive structure is unusual, ensure you:
- Selected JSON format when downloading
- Chose only the "Followers and Following" section
- Downloaded "All time" data range

### What file formats are supported?
- **Input**: Instagram Data Download ZIP files (JSON format only, not HTML)
- **Output**: Currently display only, CSV/JSON export planned for v1.6

## Technical

### Can I use it offline?
**Yes!** After the page loads, the app works completely without internet. All computation is client-side using your browser's processing power.

### Does it work on mobile?
**Yes, the UI is fully responsive.** However, for large archives (10k+ accounts), desktop is more convenient due to better performance and screen space.

### What browsers are supported?
Modern browsers with JavaScript enabled:
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

### How many accounts can it handle?
The app is optimized for massive scale:
- **1,000,000+ accounts** — tested and verified with 1M+ accounts
- **Filter speed**: <5ms for any badge combination (even 1M accounts)
- **Search speed**: <2ms with trigram/prefix indexes
- **Storage**: ~5 MB for 1M accounts (40x compression)
- **Memory**: ~5 MB runtime usage

## Comparison

### Why is this better than paid services?
- **Privacy**: 100% local processing, no data collection
- **Transparency**: Open source, you can see exactly what it does
- **No login required**: Uses official Instagram data export
- **Free**: No subscriptions or hidden costs
- **Customizable**: Modify the code for your needs
- **Offline**: Works without internet connection

### How does it compare to Instagram's built-in features?
Instagram doesn't provide unfollow tracking features. This tool fills that gap using your own exported data, giving you insights Instagram doesn't offer.

## Troubleshooting

### The app shows "No data found" - what should I do?
1. Ensure you downloaded JSON format (not HTML)
2. Check that you selected "Followers and Following" section
3. Verify the ZIP contains files like `connections/followers_and_following/following.json`
4. Try the "Load sample" button to test the app functionality

### My download is taking too long to process
- Large archives (20k+ accounts) may take 5-10 seconds to process
- Close other browser tabs to free up memory
- Use desktop browser for better performance

### The counts don't match what I see in Instagram
This is normal and expected:
- Instagram's live data changes constantly
- The export is a snapshot from when you requested it
- Some accounts may have been deleted or made private since the export
- The app shows the state at the time of your data export

## Advanced Usage

### Can I compare data from different time periods?
Currently, the app analyzes one export at a time. Historical tracking with multiple data imports is planned for v1.7.

### How accurate are the results?
Results are 100% accurate based on your Instagram data export. The app shows the exact state of your followers/following at the time you downloaded the data.

### Can I export my results?
CSV/JSON export functionality is planned for v1.6. You'll be able to save filtered results for external analysis.

### Does the app work with private accounts?
Yes, the app works with any Instagram account type (public, private, business). It only processes the follower/following data from your export.

## Technical Questions

### Why does the app need JavaScript?
The app processes your Instagram data entirely in your browser using JavaScript. This ensures your data never leaves your device and provides the best privacy protection.

### Can I run this offline?
Yes! After the initial page load, the app works completely offline. You can even save the page for offline use.

### What if Instagram changes their data format?
The app is designed to handle various Instagram export formats. If Instagram changes their format, we'll update the app to support the new format.

### Is my data stored anywhere?
Your Instagram data is stored locally in your browser's IndexedDB for fast access. It never leaves your device. You can clear data anytime by clearing browser data or uploading a new file.

### What languages are supported?
The app is available in **11 languages**: English, Spanish, Russian, German, Portuguese, Turkish, Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Arabic (with RTL support), and French. The app auto-detects your browser language.

### Can I install it as an app?
**Yes!** The app is a PWA (Progressive Web App). Click "Install" in your browser to add it to your home screen. It works fully offline after installation.
