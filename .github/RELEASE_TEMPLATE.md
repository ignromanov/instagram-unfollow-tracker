## Tips for Great Release Notes

### Do's ✅

- **Focus on user benefits** - Explain "what this means for you"
- **Use emojis sparingly** - Make sections scannable

- **Link to issues** - Give credit and provide context
- **Show gratitude** - Thank contributors and community

### Don'ts ❌

- **Don't use jargon** - Avoid technical terms unless necessary
- **Don't be vague** - "Various improvements" tells users nothing
- **Don't skip breaking changes** - Always document migrations
- **Don't forget links** - Link to docs, issues, and guides
- **Don't rush** - Take time to write clear, helpful notes

**Remember:** Release notes are often the first thing users see. Make them count!
