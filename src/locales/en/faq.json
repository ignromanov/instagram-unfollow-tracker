      "question": "Is it safe to use Instagram unfollower tracker apps?",
      "answer": "Yes, if they use your official Instagram data export. Apps requiring your Instagram password violate Terms of Service and pose security risks.

      "answer": "The ZIP file contains your profile info, followers list, following list, comments, posts, messages, saved items, and more.
